**`Founder & Engineer | Building Prediction Market Infrastructure`**

I am an Ex-Quant and AI Researcher who moved from Montreal to San Francisco to build at the intersection of **High-Frequency Trading** and **Agentic AI**. I specialize in reverse-engineering market data feeds, building decentralized vaults, and creating self-evolving agent architectures.

Previously worked at **Thirdlayer (YC W25)** on agentic memory and turned down a $400k offer to build my own vision.

### 🔭 Current Focus
* **Raven:** Building the "Bloomberg for Prediction Markets." A decentralized copy-trading vault for Polymarket using ERC4626 (Solidity/React/FastAPI).
* **HFT & Arbitrage:** Engineering low-latency pipelines (Python/C++) to front-run order books and capture arbitrage on prediction markets.
* **Second Brain:** Developing a self-evolving AI agent using MCP (Model Context Protocol) that learns from system logs and personal data to optimize workflows.

### 🏆 Highlights
* **Winner:** World’s largest AI Trading Hackathon ($10k Prize) - Built a Temporal Fusion Transformer for time-series forecasting.
* **2nd Place:** Afore Capital Hackathon - Built a political trade visualization agent.
* **Infrastructure:** Scraped the NASDAQ order book from scratch (ITCH feed) in C++.
